/**
 * Response timeout of a request that {@link HTTPHC5Impl} executes with the asynchronous HttpClient
 * transport, which it uses for HTTP/2.
 * <p>
 * HttpClient applies the response timeout of the request config as socket timeout of the
 * connection, which it skips once HTTP/2 was negotiated, as all streams share the connection.
 * Without this, a server that accepts the stream but never answers, or stalls in the middle of the
 * response, would block the sampler thread until the test is stopped. Like the socket timeout of the
 * HTTP/1.1 transport, the timeout applies to each wait for the server, so a response that keeps
 * arriving in chunks may take longer than the timeout in total.
 * <p>
 * The timeout starts when a request is handed to the connection, and every part of the request
 * body sent and of the response received restarts it. This covers every exchange HttpClient
 * executes for a sample, including those of redirects and authentication challenges. In between,
 * while an exchange waits for its connection to be leased or connected, the timeout is suspended,
 * as it does not cover that with the HTTP/1.1 transport either. HttpClient hands over the response
 * an HTTP/2 frame at a time, so a single frame which takes longer than the timeout to arrive counts
 * as inactivity, which only matters for an extremely slow link given the default maximum frame size
 * of 16 kB.
